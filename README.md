# FrontEnd Web Development Bootcamp - Bootstrap 5
Simple one page website for a fake bootcamp.

I took the design from Brad(THE MAN) Traversy's [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sosXZsdy-s) and implemented some details such as scrolling from links. The navbar is fixed so when scrolling, it didn't get to the right position. I was able to solve it with JS.
